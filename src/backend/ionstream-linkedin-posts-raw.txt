GPT-5, Open-Weight LLMs, and the ionstream Advantage — Now With B200 Availability
Yesterday, OpenAI shook up the AI landscape.
Alongside GPT-5, they released two open-weight models gpt-oss-20b and gpt-oss-120b both under Apache 2.0.

Why this matters:
For the first time since GPT-2 (2019), dev teams can run OpenAI-grade models on their own infrastructure with full control for custom training, quantization, local inference, and fine-tuning.
- Model Highlights
- gpt-oss-20b – Optimized for NVIDIA L40S (16–48GB VRAM).
- gpt-oss-120b – Designed for NVIDIA H200 (141GB HBM3e).
- Advanced capabilities: function calling, chain-of-thought reasoning, RLHF alignment.

The ionstream Fit — L40S, H200, and Now B200
We built ionstream’s bare-metal GPU-as-a-Service for exactly this moment:
- Run 20B on L40S with full-speed inference or fine-tuning.
- Deploy 120B on H200 for long-context and production batch inference.
- Leverage B200 for next-gen AI workloads that demand both high-speed inference and cutting-edge energy efficiency available now for lease.
- No virtualization. No throttling. Just raw GPU power.
- Predictable, enterprise-grade performance without the cloud cost rollercoaster.

Why It’s Big for AI Builders
- Full ownership of your model stack
- Open, transparent, decentralized LLM deployment
- Infrastructure that scales with your ambition not your budget burn

If you’re ready to move these models from announcement to production, ionstream has the hardware including B200s ready to deploy.

Lots of people are wondering when the inflection point happens and the Nvidia B200 starts driving ROI and value for inference. At Parasail two datapoints landed today:

- Llama4 Maverick: on the B200 this is now running 400 tokens per second per user and double the throughput of the H200. Huge win and this will be deployed for a customer next week. 
- Kimi 2: this a new model that just launched TODAY out of China and rivals Claude and Deepseek. It is 1 Trillion parameters, but it fits nicely onto a B200 box and we were one of the first to launch it on OpenRouter, Inc. 

We seem to be at the inflection point.

🔐 Sovereign AI demands full-stack control—and that starts with bare metal.

In an era where data sovereignty and AI autonomy are non-negotiable, bare metal servers provide the uncompromised foundation. No hypervisors. No shared tenants. Just raw, dedicated infrastructure that keeps your models, data, and compute fully under your control.

But sovereignty doesn’t mean sacrificing scalability.

⚡ GPU-as-a-Service (GPUaaS) bridges the gap—offering elastic access to high-performance GPUs when and where you need them, without giving up control of your stack.

Together, bare metal + GPUaaS unlock a new paradigm: sovereign, scalable AI that’s both powerful and private.

At 33, Jeff Hinkle, CEO of ionstream, made the leap to start his own business

He backed himself, knowing that even if it didn’t work out, he’d have time to regroup and go again

I know a lot of people hit that same crossroads, thinking about starting something of their own, weighing up the risks, wondering if now is the right time

Is it ever the right time??

At 39, I made that same call. Decided to back myself

It’s not an easy decision, but looking back, it’s one of the best I’ve ever made

The full conversation I have with Jeff is out on Thursday. Give it a listen and let me know what you think

🔍 LLM vs. SLM: What's the Difference?
LLMs are massive, general-purpose models trained on diverse datasets. They excel in complex reasoning, content generation, and multi-turn dialogue—but demand significant compute and memory.
SLMs are compact, efficient, and task-specific. They’re ideal for real-time inference, edge devices, and cost-sensitive deployments.

📈 Trends to Watch:
LLMs continue to dominate enterprise investment, especially for generative AI and RAG (retrieval-augmented generation).
SLMs are gaining momentum for their agility, interpretability, and ability to run on limited hardware.
The future is hybrid: smart orchestration between LLMs and SLMs based on task complexity and latency needs.

💡 How IonStream Supports This Evolution
At IonStream.ai, we’re building the infrastructure that powers both LLMs and SLMs—at scale and with precision.

🔥NVIDIA HGX B200

Pretty exciting installing our new NVIDIA hashtag#h200 AI cloud infrastructure at the tier 4 TRG Datacenters facility in Spring Texas!
Installing all of the 800 gig capable Juniper Networks switch fabric currently and expect to have customers online later this week.

We have pre sold many of these servers but we have some available still for immediate usage. 

Bare metal deployment through our new portal on open stack gives you a server in 10 minutes or less. 

Try it out and ask me about a free poc demo instance vm on an L40S if you want to get started .
